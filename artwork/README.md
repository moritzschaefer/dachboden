this is a vector redrawing of the dachboden robot head logo.
I only had a miniature of this logo as template (included in the svg).
the original seems to be lost.

this is a vector redrawing of the dachboden name.
I only had a miniature image the text.
the original seems to be lost.
I was not able to identify the font used, and think it has been altered.

card
====

this is a simplified black and white version of the logo + text.
it is meant to be used for toner transfer on the door access cards.
for toner transfer, don't forget to mirror the print.

stick
=====

this is a simplified version of the logo for sewing machines.
modifications:
- no color gradient since threads have only one color
- no eye glow since transparency is not really possible with threads
- all lines are paths (instead of polygons), more adapted for sewing machines
- use 2 lines instead of 4 for the head, allowing wider sewing lines
- adjust object positions so they don't overlap
